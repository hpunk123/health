                           Health does not only consist of offering medical and clinical services, such as hospitals, but also of including health directives in different political measures. Cities can be designed to provide well-being and care. For this reason, many local governments are already carrying out actions that bring health benefits through community awareness on prevention and the promotion of healthy lifestyles; the improvement of services such as basic health services, waste management, hygiene and the food chain, water and sanitation; the prioritization of people in urban and transport planning; the response to citizen needs; promoting connectivity in neighbourhoods, and improving the quality and safety of public space in favor of mental health, physical activity and social cohesion; improving road safety and traffic control to reduce damage and deaths; the protection of public assets such as soil, water, air and the environment towards an integrated model between sectors.

            Insufficient physical activity has been identified as one of the main factors for global mortality and is increasing in many countries. Regular and adequate physical activity, including any body movement that requires energy, can reduce the risk of many noncommunicable diseases and disorders, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, breast and colon cancer, and heart disease. depression. Other benefits associated with physical activity include improved bone and functional health. The energy expended while being physically active is also a critical part of energy balance and weight management. In addition to the health benefits, societies that are more active can generate additional investment returns including reduced use of fossil fuels, cleaner air, and safer and less congested streets and roads.

                Nutrition is the intake of food in relation to the dietary needs of the body. Good nutrition (a sufficient and balanced diet combined with regular physical exercise) is a fundamental element of good health.
                <br> Poor nutrition can lower immunity, increase vulnerability to disease, impair physical and mental development, and reduce productivity. Many diseases are related to nutritional imbalances, from obesity, cholesterol or stress problems, to a lack of vitamins or minerals.
                <br> That is why we must be very careful with our diet. This should not serve only to live or satisfy hunger, but to take care of health and contribute to well-being. An adequate diet covers the needs of the organism, taking into account personal characteristics, in order to achieve or maintain a good nutritional and health status.

                Because life expectancy has increased, the population of older adults (over 65 years) has increased significantly, and with it the prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases. Among these conditions is cognitive impairment, which refers to the loss of cognitive functions such as memory and learning. It should be noted that this deterioration is no longer exclusive to aging processes and is beginning to be seen at an earlier age due to other diseases such as diabetes and obesity.
